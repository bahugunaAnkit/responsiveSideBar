# responsiveSideBar
The idea is to create a basic responsive side bar with just HTML, CSS, and javascript.
Later we are going to change the style with flexbox and CSS Grid.

Steps:#
1.) html structure of the navigation list. #
2.) css style for the navigation list  #
3.) html for hamburger menu  #
4.) css style for hamburger menu # 
5.) add transition property through js - #	
		i.)style the entire thing with a negative margin as default to hide the menu  #
		ii.)access it with the help of js #
		iii.)add a class that toggles the negative margin on and off. #
		iv.)add transition property to this change. #
